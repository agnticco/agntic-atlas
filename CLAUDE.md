# Atlas — Build Constitution

Read this first, every session. It encodes the decisions that are **closed**, the
code that is **off-limits**, and the rules that keep agents from reasoning over
stale state. If something here is wrong, fix *this file* in the same commit —
don't work around it.

Full context: [`docs/agntic-ops-gap-and-build-plan.md`](docs/agntic-ops-gap-and-build-plan.md).
Commit rules: [`docs/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md`](docs/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md).

## What Atlas is

A conversational workflow builder. The system starts from a vague intent and
closes the gap through dialogue — propose one step, user confirms, measure the
distance to a complete spec, repeat — then emits a JSON spec the existing engine
executes. The hard, unbuilt IP is that **converger**.

## Closed decisions (do not re-litigate)

- **Keep the proprietary JSON spec format.** No BPMN/DMN port.
- **Multi-tenant from the foundation** *(reverses the earlier "no tenancy in
  pilot" decision, 2026-06-09).* Each onboarding client gets a `tenant_id`; users
  and every resource live underneath it. Data isolation is **hard and fail-closed**
  — one tenant's data never surfaces in another's, enforced structurally (stores
  throw on a missing tenant, never silently return all rows) and proven by
  adversarial cross-tenant tests. Auth/workflows/vault use a **shared DB with a
  bound tenant-scoping layer**; **RAG is physically isolated per tenant** (each
  tenant has its own RAG datastore/connector — cross-tenant retrieval is impossible,
  not just filtered). See [`docs/architecture/multi-tenancy.md`](docs/architecture/multi-tenancy.md).
- **All UI is built fresh.** No reuse of the dormant in-chat builder or the old
  console. Clean design language, no entanglement.
- **Fresh private repo** (this one), migrating salvage from `agntic-prod`. The
  old repo is a read-only archive.

## Don't touch (salvage — solid, high quality)

These are the expensive, correct parts. Read them, build *against* them, do not
refactor them without an explicit decision recorded here:

- **Agent core** — compiled `StateGraph`, ReAct tool loop, two-phase parallel
  planning, one human-in-the-loop pause. This is the substrate for the converger.
- **Execution engine** — topological DAG executor with real inter-step data
  threading (`{{prev}}`, `{{nodeId.output}}`, transitive fan-in), durable
  cost-tracked run logs. Best-built part of the codebase.
- **MCP connector runtime** — per-user subprocess isolation, isolation-tested,
  manifest-driven (connector #N is a config edit).
- **Auth + credential vault** — argon2id, revocable JWT sessions,
  AES-256-GCM-encrypted OAuth tokens, per-user store scoping.
- **RAG + local inference** (migrated 2026-06-08, pulled forward from the deferred
  list) — `src/rag/` + `src/llm/{llama-cpp-llm,model-pool,chat-model}.js`. Local
  open-source models via node-llama-cpp + company-context RAG. See
  [`docs/capabilities/local-models-rag.md`](docs/capabilities/local-models-rag.md).

**Recorded salvage edits** (the only intentional changes to salvage code):
- `src/rag/embedding-model.js` — local-embedding `getLlama({gpu})` was hardcoded
  `false`; made configurable (default `'auto'`, `LLAMA_GPU` to override). Hardcoded
  `false` broke on Metal-only node-llama-cpp prebuilts (Apple Silicon). 2026-06-08.
- **Multi-tenancy (2026-06-09)** — the salvage stores are scoped by `user_id`;
  tenancy adds `tenant_id` as the dominant scope. Approved edits: schema +
  fail-closed scoping in `src/auth/{user-store,session-store,oauth-token-store}.js`,
  `src/workflows/{workflow-store,feedback-store}.js`, JWT/middleware in
  `src/auth/{token-service,middleware,index}.js`, and per-tenant RAG resolution in
  `src/api/server.js`. Stores now **throw** on a missing tenant rather than
  returning unscoped rows. See [`docs/architecture/multi-tenancy.md`](docs/architecture/multi-tenancy.md).
- **compiled-graph.js resume-value consumption (2026-06-12)** — `src/graph/compiled-graph.js`
  `_runLoop`: `resumeValues[currentNode]` was never cleared after use. Every subsequent call
  to the same node name within one `_runLoop` (e.g. `clarify → analyze → clarify`) received
  stale resume values and `interrupt()` returned immediately instead of pausing, causing
  infinite loops up to the recursion limit. Fix: `delete resumeValues[currentNode]` after
  building the `InterruptContext` (one line, no behavior change for single-visit nodes).
- **Cloud inference (2026-06-12)** — `src/api/server.js` `buildLocalLLM()` replaced
  with `buildLLM()`: prefers Anthropic (claude-haiku fast / claude-sonnet balanced+powerful)
  when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, falls back to OpenAI, then local weights. `ChatModel`
  import added. Startup log now reflects actual provider. No logic changes to engine or
  salvage LLM modules.

## The frozen canonical spec

Phase 3's correctness criterion is "the converger reproduces *this exact*
hand-authored spec." When Phase 2 produces a runnable "UPS email → Slack" spec,
it is frozen at `docs/specs/canonical-ups-slack.json`, committed, and **never
regenerated**. The converger is built against that fixed target. (File appears in
Phase 2; this pointer marks where it lives.)

## Known gotchas

- **`server.js` encoding.** In `agntic-prod`, `src/api/server.js` reads as
  `data` to `file` and plain `grep` returns zero matches — it once convinced an
  agent the engine was deleted. **Root cause (verified):** the file is valid
  UTF-8 with *no* BOM; it holds a single literal NUL byte (`\x00`) at offset
  ~20198, inside a session-key template string `u:${userId}\x00${rawSessionId}`.
  That one NUL makes macOS `grep` stop early. Fix = replace/remove that NUL, not
  a re-encode. Until then use `grep -a` / `perl`. (P0 builds a *new* minimal
  server.js, so this only bites when copying logic out of the salvage file.)
  Full map: [`docs/salvage-map.md`](docs/salvage-map.md).

## Working rules

- **One deliverable per session, ending at a gate.** Rehydrate from this file +
  the module map, not from scrollback. Don't span a phase boundary in one session.
- **Close a phase before starting the next.** A phase is *closed* only when its
  gate-verified work is **merged to `main`** — not merely "gate passed" or "PR
  opened". Do not begin (or branch) phase N+1 until phase N is merged; branch the
  next phase from `main`, never from an unmerged PR.
- **Evidence-gating (load-bearing).** No agent may report something missing,
  broken, or deleted without a file path + line range, or the exact command that
  returned nothing. Negative claims need proof of absence, not absence of proof.
- **Fresh Verifier at every gate.** A gate is closed by an agent that did *not*
  write the code, with a passing check. Record it with `Gate:` + `Verified-by:`
  in the commit.
- **Don't parallelize the converger.** Phases 0–3 + the spine are serial.
  Worktree-isolate only the independent connectors and the greenfield UI surfaces.

## Agents & gate enforcement

The build runs with four roles. **Builder is this main session** (you), governed
by this file — not a subagent. The other three are subagents in `.claude/agents/`:

- **`scout`** — read-only explorer; fan out for "where does X live", returns
  conclusions with `file:line`, never edits.
- **`verifier`** — fresh, independent gate checker; did *not* write the code.
- **`adversary`** — Phase 3 only; tries to break the converger.

**Gates are HARD (fail-closed).** A phase closes only through its check:

- Each phase's objective "Done when" lives in `scripts/gates/p<phase>.sh`
  (run via `scripts/gate.sh <phase>`). They ship fail-closed — an unimplemented
  check does not pass. Fill in the real check as you build the phase.
- Run **`/gate <phase>`** to close one: it spawns the `verifier`, which runs the
  check, reviews the artifacts with evidence, and writes `docs/gates/p<phase>.md`
  only on a real pass.
- **`.githooks/pre-push`** refuses to push any commit carrying a `Gate:` trailer
  unless that phase's check passes — so a failing gate physically blocks the
  phase from being published.
- **Never `--no-verify`.** A Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook
  (`.claude/settings.json` → `.claude/hooks/block-no-verify.sh`) blocks agents
  from bypassing the commit-msg / pre-push hooks. Don't weaken the check scripts
  to force a pass either; if a check is wrong, fix it and record why here.

## Phase status

Update as gates close. `git log --grep "^Gate:"` is the authoritative ledger.

- [x] **P0** — clean spine: engine boots in new repo, UI hits one health route
- [x] **P1** — Slack connector: clicking "run" posts to Slack
- [x] **P2** — event triggers + Gmail: hand-authored UPS→Slack fires on real email *(freeze the spec here)*
- [ ] **P3** — converger reproduces the frozen spec, confirmations logged
- [ ] **P4** — builder UI: workflow built entirely by talking
- [ ] **P5** — console UI: inventory, live run monitoring, SOP view
- [ ] **P6** — launcher + builder↔console toggle
- [ ] **P7** — Airtable + Google write + error handling + sub-daily scheduling
